Objective of the Code Refactor challenge is to make this website accessibility friendly.

First we have to change the title in side the title element to convey what the website is.

Next change all the div elements to the proper html elements. Including creating a header element, nav element, footer element, and section elements.

We also want to describe the images with an alt attribute. 

There wasn't much to change on the CSS file, just make sure the targeted elements corrisponds to the html files.
